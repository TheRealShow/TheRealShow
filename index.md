## Welcome to The Real Show

The Real Show is a weekly podcast about real estate, focusing on living in Manhattan, New York City. My goal is to provide information to allow people to make informed decisions about buying vs renting through data analysis and discussion. 

The title of the show / website hub is inspired by the newspaper "The Real Deal" and the radio show "The Big Show", both coming from New York City.
