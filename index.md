## Welcome to The Real Show

The Real Show is a weekly podcast about housing.  Eventually I plan to stream / record more than once a week.  My goal is to provide information to allow people to make informed decisions about housing and real esate through data analysis and discussion. 

The title of the show / website hub is inspired by the newspaper "The Real Deal" and the radio show "The Big Show", both coming from New York City.
